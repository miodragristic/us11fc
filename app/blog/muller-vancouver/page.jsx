            From the opening whistle, Vancouver controlled the game. Laborda opened the scoring with a header from a perfect Berhalter corner, followed by Ali Ahmed setting up Sabbi for the second. Müller converted his first penalty in the 30th minute and another before halftime, giving Vancouver a commanding 4-0 lead.
